This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), called [Flight booker](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker).

The goal is to learn more about advance forms, specifically nested forms. 

Users generally don't like submitting multiple forms so simplifying into a single form whenever possible is great for user retention.

This project will create a checkout process for booking a one-way flight.
1. Enter desired dates and click 'search'
2. Choose among a list of available flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers
4. (Will be skipped) Billing information

A smaller, personal, goal is to learn about seeding databases. I have only done this manually and I should learn how to seed a database with 'fake' entries  as it's a great skill to have in the future while working in a development environment.
